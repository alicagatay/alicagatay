# Hi there, I'm Ali 👋


- 🔭 I am an aspiring software engineer from Birmingham, United Kingdom who generally enjoys building stuff: be it a full stack web page, a cross platform mobile application, or an API that people can use on their backend services. I have strong technical skills and background in software engineering, machine learning and problem solving.


- 🎓 In my university studies, I have studied a variation of subjects such as machine learning, data structures & algorithms, computer vision, and mobile & ubiquitous computing. As part of my final year dissertation, I have built a mobile application which can recommend workout moves to its user based on their messages. I have built the frontend mobile application using Flutter and Dart, and I have built the backend server and machine learning framework using Python, Tensorflow, NLTK and Flask.


- 👨‍🏫 Other than that, for the last 2 and a half years I am also volunteering at CodeYourFuture, a school that offers career-focused software development training to refugees and people from low-income backgrounds, as a technical assistant and teaching lead in order to teach full stack web development to its trainees using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js and PostgreSQL.


- 🤓 My Tech Stack:
    - 💡 Programming Languages: JavaScript, Python, Dart, Java, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Matlab, Unix Command Line
    - 🔧 Frameworks: Flutter, Django, React.js, Tensorflow, PyTorch, NLTK
    - 🔭 Developer Tools: Git, Docker, JetBrains IDE’s, VS Code, Postman, Vim
    - 👨‍🎨 Design Tools: Affinity Designer, Keynote


- 👨‍💻 My main work areas are:
    - 📡 Full stack software development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js and PostgreSQL.
    - 📱 Cross platform mobile, web & desktop application development using Flutter and Dart.
    - 💎 API development using Django and Node.js.


- 💼 I'm always looking to grow my network, so feel free to follow me on Github.
